# LandingPage
Simple html page that you can customize to your liking.

### Customizing
You must have a file named `video.mp4` in the same directory as the html file otherwise the video won't show.

The links for the buttons can be changed by changing `link` to whatever link you set it to. 

The button text can be changed by chanining button and putting whatever you want inplace of button.

Changing colors for buttons and text are easy look near the bottem of the html file and look for `color` and `background-color`.
